Here is a SQL query with CTE (common Table Expression)

Inner Statement
(SELECT
C.first_name,
C.last_name,
SUM(amount)AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_ID = D.address_ID
INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_ID = E.city_ID
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Adoni','Xintai',
				   'Dhule (Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas','Celaya',
				   'Soleopoldo')
GROUP BY 
first_name, last_name,
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5)

Outer Statement
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS total_amount_paid

Combined Statement
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS total_amount_paid
FROM(SELECT
C.first_name,
C.last_name,
